　　One of the topics in our daily life is whether or not the older people should live with their adult children. My answer to the question is that it is better for them not to.　　To begin with, adult children, like their parents, love indepen dence and freedom, but their parents may still take them as children. The situation will be worse when the adult children are married. If the relationship between the children and file parents is not harmonious, the sons or daughters of the parents will be in a difficult position. Secondly, people of different ages have different ways of life. If they live together, the old may feel that they are always disturbed and the young may feel that they are often restricted.　　In short, if the parents and their adult children do not live together, both the old and the young can enjoy complete independence and freedom. Living separately does not mean separation of relations. The parents and their children can still often visit and help each other if they stay in the saine neighborhood.

　　When you visit London, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben, the famous clock which can be heard all over the world on the B.B.C. If the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name from Sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being built. It is not only of immense size, but is extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich Observatory have the clock checked twice a day. On the B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually striking because microphones are connected to the clock tower. Big Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed to give the correct time.　　A painter who had been working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down!

　　Everyone has goals. Many people do not reach their goals for lack of planning. These three sets of goals should be developed: lifetime, intermediate and short term. Lifetime goals should be written out. These goals should be clear and reasonable. For instance, the goal to win a research prize is clear and measurable. Other lifetime goals might include publishing a certain number of influential books or articles, earning a departmental chairmanship at a major university, successfully competing for a grant from the National Science Foundation or securing a consultantship with a big corporation.　　Intermediate goals relate to outcomes during the next few years. For the beginning doctoral student, intermediate goals may include completion of course work and preparation of a doctoral research proposal. Like lifetime goals, these are measurable and clearly stated.　　Short-term goals involve outcomes expected during the next 12 months. These goals are more performance oriented, and they help with achievement of intermediate goals. Examples of short-term goals are earning an A in a course, learning how to program a computer or performing an experiment.

　　Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore? I was like that ship before my education began, only I had no way of knowing how near the harbor was.　　The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrast between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old.　　On the afternoon of that exciting day, I guessed vaguely from my mother’s signs and from the hurrying to and fro in the house that something unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps.　　I felt approaching footsteps. I thought it was my mother and stretched out my hand. Someone took it, and then I was caught up and held close in the arms of the person who had come to reveal all things to me, and, more important than that, to love me.　　The morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll. When I had played with it a little while, Miss Sullivan slowly spelled into my hand the word “d-o-l-l”. I was at once interested in this finger play and tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded in making the letters correctly I was filled with childish pleasure and pride. Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the letters for doll. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I simply made my fingers go in monkey-like imitation. In the days that followed I learned to spell in this uncomprehending way many words, among them, “pin”, “hat”, “cup”, and a few verbs like “sit”, “stand” and “walk”, but my teacher had been with me several weeks before I understood that everything has a name.　　One day while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan gave me my old doll, too. She then spelled “d-o-l-l” and tried to make me understand that “d-o-l-l” applied to both. Earlier in the day, we had a struggle over the two words “m-u-g” is “mug” and “w-a-t-e-r” is “water” , but I persisted in mixing up the two. I became impatient and, seizing the new doll, I dashed it on the floor, breaking it into pieces. I was not sorry after my fit of temper. In the dark, still world, I had no strong sentiment for anything.　　My teacher brought me my hat, and I knew we were going out into the warm sunshine. We walked down the path to the well-house. Someone was drawing water, and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand, she spelled into the other word water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still; my whole attention was fixed upon the movements of her finger. Suddenly I seemed to remember something I had forgotten - a thrill of returning thought – and the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that the “w-a-t-e-r” meant that wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul and set it free.　　I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name and each name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house, every object which I touched seemed to be full of life. That was because I saw everything with a strange, new sight that had come to me. On entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way to the fragments and tried in vain to put them together. Then my eyes were filled with tears, for I realized what I had done, and for the first time I felt sorry.　　I learned a lot of new words that day. It would have been difficult to find a happier child than me when I lay in my small bed that night and thought of the joys that day had brought to me, and for the first time I longed for a new day to come.

　　Different people have different ambitions. When children study at school, they already have their own ideals. Stone want to be engineers or doctors in the future. Others want to be artists or businessmen. Still others want to be teachers or lawyers. But few want to be farmers.　　Unlike most people, I choose to be a farmer in the future and make contributions to development of agriculture. Agriculture is essential to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Without it there won't be grains on which people survive. Nevertheless, farmers are ignored, even looked down upon by urban people. I determine to challenge the traditional idea and contribute to changing this situation.　　However, lt is not easy to he a modern farmer in the 21st century. A modern farmer must be equipped with a variety of knowledge such as chemlstry, biology and meteorology. Therefore, I must study conscientiously from now on so that I can get the chance to study as a postgraduate in an agricultural university.　　I believe only a man with scientific knowledge can meet the challenge of the 21st century and assume the task of modernizing agriculture.

　　The university opening ceremonythe deeply impressing feelings are as much a part of me now as they were a year ago.　　As the day to register and become a freshman in FDU approached,excitementincreased.Beingauniversitystudent meant I was finally coming of age. Soon I would be on my own,making my own decisions and doing what I wanted without someone looking over my shoulder.　　Despite months of anticipation, nothing could have prepared me for the impact of the actual day.Among thousands of new comers sitting on the broad lawn in front of the famous XiangHui Auditorium, listening to the speeches by the principal and student representatives, I felt myself consumed by a rush of both joy and nervousness. What would college be like? Would the other students like me? And what about the workwould I be able to keep up? Being a student in high school seemed to offer little assurance of my being able to survive college, especially in FDU which is abundant of excellent counterparts. Panic set in.It had been nice being respected as a senior by the underclass students for the past year;I didn＇t quite enjoy the idea of being on the bottom rung of the ladder again.I was not assured whether I wanted to grow up after all.　　As if in a daze, I rose up with my new classmates around to show respect to the school song which was to be performed. As the solemn music flowed, I knew that I was hearing not just a song but the foot step of a brand new life. Exciting as the prospeet of a new life seemed, it wasn＇t quite easy saying goodbye to the old onethe familiar faces, the familiar routine. I would eyen miss those days when fully engaged in preparing for the college entrance exams though they were so tiring and the long commute between home and school that took me several hours each week. Good or bad, it was that I knew.　　This September, I was one of the volunteers to welcome the new comers and guide them around the campus. I found the familiar mixed feelings shown on their faces. I needn＇t have worried about if I would like FDU, since my year here has turned out to be one of the best years of my life. Although going back to those days is impossible, it＇s comforting to know I can revisit my special memories any time.

　　There was once a man that thought he knew everything, and he kept showingoff to the people in his country. As time passed, many people began to feel,that this smart man, could even beat the professor of the king. Now this kingwas very proud, but the professor was not so at all. But the professor said,“Don’t say it too soon;” and from those words, he began to decide which hardquestion to ask the man.　　At last he thought of a funny question, “He shall never find the answer!Ha!” it all happened that the clever man whom I have told you; had a big stage.All the people that have questions, should stand on this stage, and ask him whatthe problem or question is.　　One day the professor piled up in the line, and waited for his turn. Whenit was his turn, he asked the smart man, “I don’t think you could answer thisquestion my lord,” said the professor smiling, “I could answer all of themfoolish professor!” shouted the man with an angry tongue, “Tell me what thequestion is, and I shall prove to you that I can answer every question; if Ican, then I shall ask you a question; if you do not give me the correct answer,then I shall kill you!” shouted the man.　　“But what if you don’t?” asked the professor, “Then you shall stand on thisstage and I shall hire servants to serve you;” said the man with a laugh. Theprofessor then began his question, “What is the first tower in 1910, and 1911;and 1912, and 1913…and 20xx? And what is the height of them? If they all stackup, then how tall would it be?” “Ugh, give me a sec would you mind?” and then hebegan to calculate; but he couldn’t find the answer.” “What’s wrong?” asked theprofessor with a smile, “Couldn’t find the answer, perhaps?” “No, I-I-I-I justne-ed… Ugh, fine; you win! Ugh!” and so the professor soon became king and ruledhis country wise and well. People asked him many other questions, and theprofessor answered them all. The clever man that thought he knew everything,however, was locked up in a cage for his cruelty to the king.　　The moral of this story is, when you think you know everything; don’t thinkso; for maybe a question will ruin your brain----Lulu read.

　　The first memory I have of him- of anything, really is his strength. It was in the late afternoon in a house under construction near ours. The unfinished wood floor had large, terrifying holes whose big and opening darkness I knew led to nowhere good. His powerful hands,then age 33, wrapped all the way around my tiny arms, then age 4, and easily swung me up to his shoulders to command all I surveyed.　　The relationship between a son and his father changes over time. It may grow and flourish in mutual maturity. It may sour in hated dependence or independence. With many children living in single-parent homes today, it may not even exist.　　But to a little boy right after World War II, a father seemed a god with strange strengths and strange powers enabling him to do and know things that no mortal could do or know. Amazing things, like putting a bicycle chain back on,just like that. Or building a hamster cage. Or guiding a Jigsaw　　so it forms the letter F: I learned the alphabet that way in those pre-television days.　　There were, of course, rules to learn. First came the handshake. None of those cold little finger grips, but a good firm squeeze accompanied by an equally strong gaze into the other's eyes. "The first thing anyone knows about you is your handshake , 'he would say. And we' d practice it each night on his return from work, the serious toddler in the battered Cleveland Indian's cap running up to the giant father to shake hands again and again until it was firm enough.　　我对他的第一印象—一对他的任何事情的第一印象，说真的——是他的力量。在一个下午的晚些时候，在我家附近的工地上，那尚未完工的木制地板张着它那巨大恐怖的黑糊糊的嘴，给人以不祥之预感。父亲时年33岁，他用他那有力的双手抱起了4岁的我，把我放在他的肩膀上，让我岛瞰一切。　　父子之间的关系随着时间的变化而变化。它可以在父子间共同的成熟过程中发展深化，也会在充满怨恨的不独立或独立的过程中变坏。由于现今社会许多孩子生活在单亲家庭中，父子关系甚至可能不存在了。　　但对于一个生活在二战刚结束时的男孩来说，父亲好像是神，他的神奇的'力量和超凡的能力使他知晓一切，能做一切事，这是一般常人所办不到的，像重新给自行车装上链条或做一个仓鼠笼子或教我玩拼图玩具拼出一个字母“F”这类奇妙的事，在那个没有电视机的时代，我就是以这种方式来学习字母的。　　当然，还有一些做人的道理要学。首先是握手。握手不是那种冷冰冰的手指相握，而是一种强有力的握手，同时坚定有力地注视对方。他会说，“人们首先是通过与你握手来了解你的。”每天晚上下班回来，我们练习握手。严肃认真的刚会走路的小孩头戴一顶破克利夫兰印第安帽，踉踉跄跄地奔向威武高大的父亲，与他一次又一次地握手，直至握得坚定有力。

　　These two drawings, apparently, can be associated with two distinct habits. In the left one, there is a girl beside a desk, being absorbed in learning, with an idea in her mind —it is advisable to complete as early as possible. By contrast, in the right picture, a young guy sits leisurely in a sofa, telling himself, “I need not act until the deadline.” Finally, two Chinese characters can be noticed, which say “habit”.　　Successful figures are usually characterized by their diverse merits, including diligence, perseverance and striving every day. However, in reality, a host of youngsters are accustomed to taking no action until the last day. This terrible habit is particularly worth concerning and as a matter of fact, their laziness has constituted an obstacle that hinders their personal growth and progress.　　To my understanding, we are supposed to accomplish our assignments on time each day. This good habit can be likened to a journey, leading to success and a promising future. A case in point is myself. During the past year, as a senior who has been preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduates, I have never postponed one day’s task until the next day. This excellent habit ensures my motivation for learning, brings me power and helps me accumulate knowledge every day.　　To conclude, never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. Meanwhile, every one should bear in mind that a positive habit means a lifelong treasure.

　　Most people, when given an opportunity to aid someone in need, are eager to do whatever they can to be of service. Those of us who have chosen to make healing the world a vocation are grateful for any occasion to send light and love to people in our immediate spheres of influence and beyond. As we apply our passion and our principles to this altruistic endeavor, we often forget to send ourselves the same bountiful gifts of wellness, though we ourselves may be in dire need of it. We overlook ourselves, not because we forget, but because we fear that focusing on the self is an indicator of selfishness. It is moreover much more difficult to heal oneself than to heal others because the seeds of uncertainty are more easily banished when we act on anothers behalf. When we send healing light to ourselves, it is important that our intentions and our self-trust be stronger than ever to counteract doubt. As we bless ourselves in this way, we serve as both an active channel and a passive destination. This should not change the way we interact with the valuable energy we wish to receive, however. Though we may be tempted to consciously direct or influence the manner in which light impacts our lives because we know ourselves most intimately, we should not try to control its path. When we draw the white light of protection and purity to our bodies, taking it into ourselves with each inhalation, our belief in the fact that it will naturally move toward areas of dysfunction will ensure that it flows through every muscle and organ. And when we fill our spaces with this light, our environments are cleared of all the negative energy that can sap our strength and our spirit. Surrounded inside and out with healing light, we feel safe and protected, healthy, relaxed, and content just as those who regularly receive such loving gifts from us do. If you sincerely believe that there is a part of yourself that exists independently of upset and illness, the love and light you send yourself will help you connect with it.
